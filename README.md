This is an AI solver for the 15-puzzle game (For reference, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

Given a text file representing a shuffled game board, this solver figures out whether or not a solution is possible, and if so, efficiently computes the solution requiring the fewest number of moves, and outputs each of those moves to the console.

To run, execute Solver, with the name of any text file in the root directory (e.g. puzzle50.txt) as the parameter.
